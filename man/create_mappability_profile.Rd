\usage{
create_mappability_profile(
  path_to_bam_files,
  category,
  window = 75,
  virus_info
)
}
\arguments{
\item{path_to_bam_files}{Path to the folder that stores the indexed and
sorted BAM file(s) (ending in \verb{*.sorted.bam} and \verb{*.bai}).}

\item{category}{Type of unreliable region you are creating. You can use
categories in the provided \code{unreliable_regions} data frame or customize
in your own way.}

\item{window}{The sliding window size of your choice. Default is 75.}

\item{virus_info}{A DNAStringSet of virus segments. The format should be similar to \code{virus_segments}.}
}
\value{
A data frame of start and end positions of the regions that are
considered unmappable.
}
\description{
Creates a data frame of start and end positions of the regions
that are considered unmappable. Unmappable areas indicate that they can
be mapped to another virus segment or a host genome. Note that we only
have Arabidopsis Thaliana as a host.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
## Please change the path to your folder where you store the mapped viruses
mappability_profile <- create_mappability_profile("path/to/folder",
  category = "Unmappable regions")
}
